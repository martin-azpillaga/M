# M

M is a data oriented programming language for game developers.

It increases the productivity of professionals by reducing both the development and maintenance time of projects, while making the overall process more enjoyable!

It is built following the philosophy of the excellent quote:

>Everything should be as simple as it can be, but no simpler.

>Albert Einstain [?](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/)

## Key features

* M is data oriented.

    M encourages data oriented design natively. A programming paradigm that has proven to be specially well suited for developing games.

    This improves the overall performance by and flexibility of the project. Learn more about data oriented design in the [Link to data oriented design summary](gitlink).

* M involves all the team.

    No matter if you are an artist, a programmer, a designer or even a project manager, you can leverage M to better communicate your ideas across your team.

    Link to LSP and blockly editor.

* M is extensible.

    The outcome of a game described using M is not a executable game but rather a game project in a game engine.
    integrates with existing tools. Link to Unity.

    If there is something you would like to modify or add just modify the resulting project.

## Get started

You can interact with M using its visual or textual editor.

* Visual Editor workflow: You can try a Scratch-like block editor online for free at [the editor's page](/editor/) and play around with blocks. For example you could declare an entity by combining the following blocks:
![image](/images/blockExample)

* Textual editor workflow: Head to the releases and download the [latest standalone editor](gitlink). It requires no installation, extract it and you can start playing with it.

## Become an expert

You can become an export in M within a week thanks to its documentation. Just head to [online documentation page](/documentation/en/home.md) and discover all its benefits with your own hands.

You can also get inspiration by inspecting the [example projects](examplesgitlink) hosted in this repository.

## Development Roadmap / Project status

The project M has been in active development for two years with over 3000 hours of research and development time.

 and will continue being developed.

and has over 3000 hours of research and development invested in it. although it has oly become part of github since mid 2019.

The project is still in continuous developmnet. Stay tuned about the next planned features by checking the public [kanban project](gitlink).
