# The language of video games
M is a programming language built specifically for game development. It embraces the Entity Component System paradigm to facilitate the creation of flexible yet performant projects. It is built to make game development more enjoyable, by making the developers more productive and simplifying the process following the philosophy



> Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler.

### M is for everyone
M tries to involve all the technical roles in development: Artists - drawers, modelers, , programmers, designers

Textual programming | Visual programming

Programmers will feel at home with the C-like syntax | Artists and designers can also contribute by expressing their ideas using Scratch-like blocks
Faster to develop with | Easier to learn and use

Both approaches have the same expressive power, meaning that any program made using an approach can b emade using the other. Moreover, programs can be automatically translated from an interface to the other to approach every problem in the desired form.
