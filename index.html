<h1 id="what-is-m">What is M</h1>
<p>M is a data oriented programming language for developing games and interactive experiences.</p>
<p>M increases productivity by reducing the development <em>and</em> maintenance time of projects.</p>
<p>The following quote represents the philosophy behind the project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything should be as simple as it can be, but no simpler</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-do-i-care">Why do I care</h2>
<ul>
<li>M is data oriented</li>
</ul>
<p>M encourages data oriented design by default, a programming paradigm proven to be specially well suited for game development.</p>
<p>This improves the performance and flexibility of the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>M involves all your team</li>
</ul>
<p>Programmers will feel at home developing in a vs-code-based text editor.</p>
<p>Artists and designers might prefer the block based online visual editor.</p>
<p>Tool developers can extend the headless program and develop their your own tools.</p>
<p>The connection of these interfaces allows everyone to communicate their ideas better, across the entire team.</p>
<ul>
<li>M integrates in your workflow</li>
</ul>
<p>M doesn't generate executable games, but game projects that you can edit using a game engine.</p>
<p>You can inspect the generated code, tweak design values and customize the look with art pieces made in your favorite content creation program.</p>
<p>M does not compete with the tools you know and love. It provides you with a tool that will improve your development journey.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-get-it">How can I get it</h2>
<p>M is an open source software licensed under the AGPL license.</p>
<p>In non legal terms, it means that you have the freedom to use it, inspect it and make your own version, for free.</p>
<p>You can also redistribute it, but make sure you do it under the same license.</p>
<p>If you agree, you can download the latest version. No need for installation. You are ready to start.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>You can get your first game project running in five steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download and run the editor</li>
<li>Download the code for the example project</li>
<li>Place the file in the workspace of the editor</li>
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>You can find your customizable project in the generated Unity folder</li>
</ol>
<p>Optionally, in three more steps, you will be editing the code visually online:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open the block based online editor</li>
<li>Click upload and select the <code>example.blocks</code> found in the Blocks folder</li>
<li>Try experimenting with different kinds of blocks.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to understand more about how this works and develop your own projects, check the beginner guide in the documentation.</p>
<p>It includes a step by step guide for creating your first project from scratch, how to guides for common use cases and guided examples.</p>
<h2 id="go-deeper">Go deeper</h2>
<p>The documentation also contains guides for users and developers.</p>
<p>Learn about the syntax of M, the special semantics for interactive experiences and troubleshooting for common issues you might encounter to use it efficiently.</p>
<p>Make sure you fulfill the prerequisites before reading a guide and you will become an expert in no time.</p>
<p>Then you may become a contributor and shape the development of the M project.</p>
<p>The structure and design decisions behind the source code are also written in the documentation.</p>
