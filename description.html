with a simple and flexible tool.</p> <p>It is (a) free and open source project/software, available for preview/-as a preview- on all major desktop platforms.
/
It is a free and open source project in active development.
A prototype is available for all major desktop platforms.</p> <h2 id="m-complements-your-workflow"><a href="#m-complements-your-workflow" class="header-anchor">#</a> M complements your workflow</h2> <p>It does not aim to replace existing tools, but complement them.</p> <h3 id="editor-of-your-choice"><a href="#editor-of-your-choice" class="header-anchor">#</a> Editor of your choice</h3> <p>M is distributed/delivered/available as a language server. (an independent process...)</p> <p>(Modern) code editors can communicate with it via the language server protocol
(to provide a rich development experience)</p> <p>It can be integrated in code editors that implement the LSP* protocol (such as VSCode, Eclipse or Vim).</p> <p>This means that programmers can use their editor of choice to develop in M, such as VSCode or Vim. (any uptodate code editor like vscode or vim)</p> <h3 id="engine-of-your-choice"><a href="#engine-of-your-choice" class="header-anchor">#</a> Engine of your choice</h3> <p>The language server detects source files written in M and generates (a configurable) output.</p> <p>However, the output is not an executable program, but source code that games engines (can) understand.</p> <h3 id="simplicity-first"><a href="#simplicity-first" class="header-anchor">#</a> Simplicity (first)</h3> <p>The goal is to make writing and specially reading code simple.</p> <p>It starts with a familiar syntax, it inherits the syntax from C-like languages.</p> <h3 id="minimal-grammar"><a href="#minimal-grammar" class="header-anchor">#</a> Minimal grammar</h3> <p>And defines a minimalist grammar.
The grammar is minimalist,  specially when compared to Java or C++.</p> <p>Programs are written/composed (by) combining few orthogonal building blocks.</p> <p>This defines a clear path for writing the solution to (programming) problems.
Keeps programmers focused on the problem rather than designing/deciding on how to solve it.</p> <p>This is possible thanks to a game oriented standard library that includes many components and functions related to game dev and the implicit type inference.</p> <h3 id="type-inference"><a href="#type-inference" class="header-anchor">#</a> Type inference</h3> <p>It supports entity component system architecture. Instead of working with classes and methods you work with systems and components.</p> <p>It also leads to code thats easier to maintain. Since everyone understands the building blocks and the boilerplate free grammar, reading a program written in M is easier.</p> <p>Don't get fooled by its simplicity. We make a big effort to make the language server itself efficient and to output souce code that is performant: Multithread ready and cache friendly.</p> <h3 id="flexible"><a href="#flexible" class="header-anchor">#</a> Flexible</h3> <h3 id="data-oriented-composition-over-inheritance"><a href="#data-oriented-composition-over-inheritance" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data oriented composition over inheritance</h3> <p>composition over inheritance lets designers create new entities with new behaviour by mixing
M enforces data oriented design natively.</p> <p>In particular, it follows the Entity Component System paradigm to decouple
the game into independent systems describing the logic and components
that hold all the data.</p> <h3 id="no-literals"><a href="#no-literals" class="header-anchor">#</a> No literals</h3> <p>More importantly, M improves the flexibility of game designers.</p> <p>M has no literal values.
All the data is stored in components,
which means that designers can tweak all the parameters from within the game editor.</p> <p>With M, programming and designing become independent jobs,
providing an important boost in team productivity.</p> <h3 id="the-author"><a href="#the-author" class="header-anchor">#</a> The author</h3> <p>My name is Martin. I'm 28. I started programming when I was 14 and haven't stopped since.</p> <p>I love learning. I graduated in Maths and Software Engineering in Barcelona and then went to Manchester for a masters in Mathematical logic. I (thoroughly) enjoyed my studies (a lot). Still, I think I have learned more thanks to my personal projects.</p> <p>I have always had a project going, from small games to programs to assist in math. I have finally found my passion in developing software tools. Programs that allow developers, including myself, be more productive.</p> <p>After starting developing M, I decided to focus on it seriously.</p> <p>I rejected a PhD offer from Manchester University, moved back to my parents' home and focus on developing my project.</p> <p>Thanks to some savings, a modest lifestyle and invaluable help from my parents, I have been able to keep developing M.</p> <p>And after three years of hard work I'm excited to share a prototype with the world and apply for this grant. I am a big proponent/fan of free software.</p> <p>When I first heard of Epic Megagrants I thought it was only for big enterprises, but some months ago I saw some individuals got grants too.</p> <p>I will be honest. Now my savings are gone and soon I will start applying for developer jobs. I am ready to try it, but that will mean leaving M as a secondary project.</p> <p>Having the goal of applying for this grant has pushed me into polishing the poject into a presentable state.</p> <h3 id="possible-impact"><a href="#possible-impact" class="header-anchor">#</a> Possible impact</h3> <p>This project has been extremely ambitious since its inception.</p> <p>In the best case scenario, it could make an impact in the professional lives of millions of game developers. Making them more productive and hopefully enjoy their work even more.
I want to clarify that I don't envision anyone dropping C#, C++ or GD for M, but use them together as part of the interdisciplinary game development teams.</p> <p>In the worst case, It would go unnoticed and be forgotten. It could happen for not eecuting the idea properly, lack of interest or poor marketing. But I believe in this project. Even in the worst case, it would have been my biggest achievement to date.</p> <h3 id="current-status"><a href="#current-status" class="header-anchor">#</a> Current status</h3> <p>M is a free and open source project (hosted in Github./(still) in active development).</p> <p>A prototype for all major operating systems is (publicly) available for download.</p> <p>A prototype exists in the form of an extension vscode based editors: Visual Studio Code and VSCodium.</p> <h3 id="future-plan"><a href="#future-plan" class="header-anchor">#</a> Future plan</h3> <p>I track the progress and pending tasks of the project using Github's issue tracker.</p> <p>The planning is publicly available and classifies the tasks depending on how they add/ the value they add to the project.</p> <ul><li>Development tasks add new features</li> <li>Documentation tasks make the project easier to learn</li> <li>Maintenance: Easier to develop</li> <li>User experience: Easier to use</li> <li>Social: Easier to find and try out</li></ul> <p>To give an important example</p> <p>The ultimate goal is to keep dedicating hours to the development of the tool, on whatever becomes prioritary. And steadily make the prject a robust and complete solution that developers/programmers can rely on.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
