And I'm the creator of M.
A new programming language for game developers.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">In this video, I will give an overview of the key features of M.
For detailed information, visit the link to the documentation at the end of the video.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Keep in mind, that the project is still in active development.
Not all the features presented here are fully implemented yet.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">However, an early prototype of M is available for the public.
And I will be using that throughout this demo.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Ok, let'ss do this.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## M is a tool</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">One of the design goals of M is to be a tool that you can integrate in your workflow.
It's not aiming to replace your development stack but rather complement it.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Let me explain.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Editor of your choice</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">M is a free and open source language server.
An independendent application that communicates with code editors via the LSP.
The Language Server provides rich development experience.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">It knows the answers to code editor requests like:
Could you please complete this word?
veloc  -> velocity
or Is this file gramatically correct ?
file icon -> No, error in line 10.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">In practice, you can develop a project in M using the editor of your choice.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">In this demo, I will use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">I can search for the M language server extension in the marketplace, install it.
And that's it, I'm ready to start developing!</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Engine of your choice</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">This is a simple project written in M.
It consists of a single .m file that holds all the code.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">If you are a C or Java developer, you might find the syntax familiar.
However, the execution semantics are quite different.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Maybe you've spotted that there is a syntax error in this file.
VSCode knows about it too, I missed a closing bracket.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Let's fix it.
Now that our project is free of errors, M has produced an output folder for us.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Inside, you won't find an executable file.
Instead, M generates source code that game engines can understand.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">That's right.
M is meant to be used Alongside your game engine, be it Unity, Unreal or Godot.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">M has generated readable C# Unity classes for every component and system.
Similarly, M has generated C++ files for Unreal project.
And GDScript scripts if you plan to work with Godot.
All these files will be regenerated whenever we modify our .m source files.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">The idea is to use M to write the code and the game engine as the level editor.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Let me open the Unity project. Pong demo ??</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Show the system debugger and entity debugger.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">M doesn't generate executable games, but game projects that you can edit using
a game engine.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">You can inspect the generated code, tweak design values and customize the look
with art pieces made in your favorite content creation program.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Properties</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">But then, why use M in the first place?
Why not develop the code in the engine's language?</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">As every good tool, M solves one problem and one problem well.
It is only when you combine it with other great tools that you can create
something amazing.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">So what is the problem that M is trying to solve?
To develop gameplay programming code in a simple, maintainable and performant way.
Code that's easy to understand, gives the game designers maximal flexibility
yet can run fast, using the resources of modern computers efficiently.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">### M is simple</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Which means it's easy to write and Specially easy to read.
Being focused on the game development domain allows M to have a concise syntax.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Its standard library defines components that are common in games like
velocity, mass or materials.
So you can focus on the components that are unique to your game.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Defining new components is easy.
Use them in a system and the type inference will deduce it's type.
No need for class declarations or type annotations.
M's powerful type inference will deduce all the types for you
and show an error when something does not quite fit.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">### M is flexible</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">M enforces data oriented design natively.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">In particular, it follows the Entity Component System paradigm to decouple
the game into independent systems describing the logic and components
that hold all the data.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">I can remove this system and I don't have to worry about affecting other parts.
Which makes debugging code easier.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">More importantly, M improves the flexibility of game designers.
M has no literal values.
All the data is stored in components,
which means that designers can tweak all the parameters from within the game editor.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">In fact, programming and designing become independent jobs,
providing an important boost in team productivity.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">### M is powerful</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Don't get fooled by the simplicity.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">M can generate cache friendly and multithread ready code.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Take a look.
I can toggle this switch and now all the code is running in parallel across cores.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Pong is a classic example that every game developer can understand,
but M is capable of much more.
You can code 3D games with animations, advanced physics, networking, AI...
covering all areas of gameplay programming.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">And remember, if you find something missing, don't worry.
You can always use the engine's language to solve it and use both
approaches in collaboration.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Call to action</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">That's it for this video.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">From here, I leave you with two options.
If you are a hands on person, go to minim.tools/M and follow the Starter guide.
If you are more interested in the technical aspects,
including experimental features not mentioned in this video,
I recommend you to check out the Developer Guide at minim.tools/M.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Feel free to contact me at martin@minim.tools.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Thanks for watching.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Description</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">It's a research heavy project.
I have rewritten the whole codebase at least three times, probably more.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Links</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">[Build](https://github.com/martin-azpillaga/M/releases/latest/download/m.vsix)</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">[Video](https://minim.tools/M#presentation-video)</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">Email
