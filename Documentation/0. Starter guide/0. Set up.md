# The code editor

The easiest way to start developing in M is to download the oficial code editor.
Download the [linux] or [windows] version. It includes the documentation and the
visual coding widget.

## The game engine

M supports the [Unity] game engine, but thanks to its adaptable nature, support
for the [Unreal] and [Godot] game engines will be possible in the future.

You need a Unity version 2019.3+, preferably 2019.4. You can find the installer
for free [here].

## The dependencies

Make sure you have Java version or later installed in your computer. You can
check this by writing java -version in the command line. If it prints out an
error, please download Java 11.

## The project folder

A project of M consist of a folder. Once you start writing code in this folder,
you will find a folder named src-gen with the output of the code.
Once you finish coding, you can open the generated files in the editor.
Let's look at an example in [creating your first project].
