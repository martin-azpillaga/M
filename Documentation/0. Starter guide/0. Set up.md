# Setting up the environment

The easiest way to start developing in M is to install the vscode extension.
Download the **M language server** extension from the Visual Studio Code's marketplace.

## Dependencies

The M language server requires Java >= 8 set up in your path.
To know your version of java run the command

~~~ shell
java -version
~~~

and check that the printed version is higher than 8.
If the version is lower or the java command is not found, you will need to
[download Java] and add it to the path.

## All set up

Congratulations, you are ready to [create your first project]!
