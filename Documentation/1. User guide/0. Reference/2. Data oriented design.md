# Data oriented design

Everything is data. Introducing the data model:

The data matrix and the variable heap hold all the data of a frame of a game.

Our job as programmers is to define the laws that transform this data every frame.

The possible ways to alter the data are:

- Create a new row in the matrix (Entity creation)

- Delete a row in the matrix (Entity deletion)

- Activate a cell in the matrix (Component addition)

- Deactivate a cell in the matrix (Component removal)

We can use the variable heap to store temporary values. The system automatically deletes this values after every frame.

- Create an entry in the heap (Variable declaration)

Now we need a way to gather values to write to the matrix cells and the heap.

- Read a value stored in a cell (Component access)

- Read a value stored in the heap (Variable access)

These are the atoms of data. We can transform the data by using transformations:

- Operators: Arithmetic, Comparison, Logic, Set operators
- Grouping: Join, Set creation, Brackets...
- Functions: Math functions.

Control Flow.

We may repeat this process per matching row (Forall), while a condition is true (Iteration) or if a condition is true (Selection).

And that is the whole grammar of M.
