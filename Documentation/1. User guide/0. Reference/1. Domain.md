# Game engine support

The [Unity] game engine with the hybrid Unity ECS approach.

## Magic components

Names that have a special meaning inside M:

* Components ending in XTriggered are of type boolean and X of type input.

* Components matching XRange are of type float1 and X of type input.

* Components matching XVector are of type float2 and X or type input.

The built in Input engine system reads the actual input if both X and XRange are
present.
