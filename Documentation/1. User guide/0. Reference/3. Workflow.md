# Workflow

M operates in four stages: Parsing, validating, generating and formatting.

The parser processes the input given by the user and checks for syntactical
errors. The result is an abstract syntax tree containing all the essential
information of the file, all the data without white spaces.

The validator checks the information of the abstract tree for semantic validity.
The result is an Eclipse Modeling Framework model of the abstract representation
of the interactive simulation.

The generating represents the model in all the requested platforms, including
textual representations in different languages, visual representations in
different languages and project representations in different game engines. The
result is a folder with all the required files for representing that simulation
in each platform.

The formatter mixes white space with the generated text so that humans can
understand it.

## For each view

M has three main views: Textual, Visual and Project. These might appear
translated to different natural languages. For instance, English, Spanish and
Basque. The total number of combinations is the product of views by
translations.
