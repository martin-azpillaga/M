## Build configurations

Users can configure the builds writing a m.project file.
Is a json file with two fields: Sources and targets.
Sources is an array of glob patterns specifying all the files the compiler will compile, including files in different languages.

A target object has two fields: Kind and path.
Kind specifies the kind of transformation. For example, Unity, Blockly or M.
Path represents the folder where the output will be.
