# Animation

Animation refers to modifying the data of your simulation depending on the time.
An animation is anything related to time. This is useful for creating timers, sprite animations, mesh animations and cut scenes.

## Timers

Three magic components define timer behavior:

- XElapsed: Every elapsed component will get its value increased by deltaTime everyFrame.

- X: If an entity has both XElapsed and X, the elapsed component will restart when it's value is larger than X's.

- XTimeout: If an entity has XElapsed, X and XTimeout, XTimeout will be true in the frames where the elapsed time has restarted.

## Sprite animations
