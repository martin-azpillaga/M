# Workflow

M operates in four stages: Parsing, validating, generating and formatting.

In the parsing process, the input given by the user is processed and checked for
syntactical errors. The result is an abstract syntax tree containing all the
essential information of the file, all the data without white spaces.

In the validating process, the information of the abstract syntax tree is
checked for semantic validity. The result is an Eclipse Modeling Framework model
of the abstract representation of the interactive simulation.

When generating, the model is represented in all the requested platforms,
including textual representations in different languages, visual representations
in different languages and project representations in different game engines.
The result is a folder with all the required files for representing that
simulation in each platform.

When formatting, the generated text is mixed with white space so that humans can
understand it easily.

## For each view

M has three main views: Textual, Visual and Project. These might appear
translated to different natural languages. For instance, English, Spanish and
Basque. The total number of combinations is the product of views by
translations.
