## Five influential games

As example games we have selected some of the most influential, iconic and
successful games in their era. Small in scope but still interesting enough to
illustrate the different aspects the language M is capable of.

You can start with the classic game of [Pong], developed by Atari in 1972, where
you will learn the basics of entity and system creation and physics
interactions.

Next is the [Space Invaders] game, developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and
distributed by Taito in 1978. You will learn about batch creation of entities,
creation and destruction of entities in runtime.

For the 80's era we have chosen the well known [Pacman] and [Mario]. In Pacman
you can learn how to use reinforcement learning AI techniques and in Mario how
to design diverse levels.

For the 90's we enter the era of 3D graphics. To showcase this ability, we have
created a demo of [Crash Bandicoot], developed by Naughty Dog, that combines all
the concepts in a three dimensional game.
