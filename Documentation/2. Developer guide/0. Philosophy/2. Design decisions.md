# Design decisions

## Lexer

The lexer is derived from the Unicode standard.
It accepts all character code points in the
Base Multilangual Plane: U+0000 to U+FFFF.

It classifies the characters in character classes
given by the unicode consortium and then merges together
in the major character groups:

* Letter
* Number
* Punctuation
* Symbol
* Blank
* Control

For the case of M, three terminals are interesting:

* Identifiers are a nonempty string of letters
* Operators are a nonempty string of symbols
* Blanks are a nonempty string of blanks
* All the rest are unrecognized characters

## Syntax

To distinguish parser rules from each other, some keywords
are necessary. In M, the keywords are taken from the punctuations
class.
This is because it is not involved in the interesting terminals and
keeps the syntax natural language agnostic.

The syntax of M is inspired in the family of C-like
programming languages.

The keywords in M are:

* Brackets for grouping: (), [], {}
* Commas for indicating sequences: ,
* Equality for assignment: =
* Dot for cell access: .

## Parser

The parser of M is inspired in maths. In particular,
minimal Turing complete languages with infix operator support
and a special expression in cells from ECS paradigms.

A program is a list of functions.
A function has a name, a list of parameters and a list of statements.
A statement is either a block statement, an assignment or a delegation.
A block statement has a name, a expression and a list of statements.
An assignment assigns an expression to a value or a cell.
A delegation delegates work to another function and receives the output.
An expression can be a binary operator, a unary operator,
a function application, a value or a cell.

## Type system

The system is inspired in the theory of algebraic types.
M supports 
* sum types: a + b: either type a or b
* product types: a x b: a tuple of (type a, type b)
* exponent types: a -> b: a function from type a to b
* polymorphic types: f\<a\>: functions on types, for example List\<Number\>.

Expressions get typed for two reasons:

* Symbol typed in standard library
* Entity of a cell

Typing errors occur when either:

* Not enough information to infer the type of an expression
* The inferred information is not coherent or compatible

## Standard library

The standard library defines the types, symbols and errors messages that are available to all files written in M. Symbols are
names with an associated predefined type. For example,
The symbol mass will always have the
type number. However, its name will depend on the specific
instance of standard library that is in use. In fact, two
instances of the standard library are provided, one using
English as the natural language and the other using Euskara.

The collection of symbols is inspired in game development,
mostly in the standard components of the Unity game engine.
Commonly used properties and functions are included. In
particular, from the seven main areas of game development:

* Rendering
* Audio
* Networking
* Input
* Physics
* AI
* Animation

Functions are inspired in math libraries and the matrix model
of the ECS paradigm (CRUD over the matrix):

* All the data is stored in a conceptual matrix
* The rows represent entities and the columns components
* All the simulation in the game happens by modifying the matrix
* By removing and adding rows we create and destroy entities
* Columns can not be altered at runtime (no dynamic components)
* By setting or nullifying cells we add and remove components
* By querying for column sets we iterate over entities with
specific sets of components
* By looking wheter a row has a column active we determine whether
an entity has a component or not

It also provides messages to form the error messages. Five kinds
of errors can happen in M:

* Syntax error: Didn't follow the grammar rules
* Symbol undefined: Used a symbol that has not been defined
* Symbol redefined: Defined a symbol that was already defined
* Undecidable type: Not enough information to infer type of an
expression
* Incompatible types: Inferred multiple types for an expression
that are not compatible between them.
For example, number and numeric or sum types are compatible.

## Validation algorithm

Custom inference algorithm determines the types of all expressions
involved in a program written in M and reports errors if the
process goes badly.
