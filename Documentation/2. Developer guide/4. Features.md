# Responsability view

Public methods orchestrate the work. Explain the flow and delegate.
Private methods do the actual work manipulating the data.

## VSCode extension

- Define marketplace page's information
- Define bracket features and snippets declaratively
- Detect missing dependencies (Java 8+) and offer solutions
- Detect extension activation events and start language server
- Associate .Ⲙ and Ⲙ.json files with Ⲙ and watch for modifications

### Package.json

- Define name version publisher and license
- Define descriptions and keywords
- Define icon, preview label and no q&a section
- Link to webpage, repository and issues
- Contribute language Ⲙ for .Ⲙ files
- Activate extension when Ⲙ files opened or workspace contains a Ⲙ or Ⲙ.json file
- Activation starts in main.js
- Define dependency on vscode-language client and vscode engine (required by vsce)

### Brackets.json

- Indent and dedent automatically with {}
- Create folding markers with {}
- Highlighting bracket pairs for {} [] and ()
- Autoclose brackets {} [] ()
- Surround selection with brackets {} [] ()

### Snippets.json

- Snippets for foreach, if, set and system
- Snippets respect current indentation even if they span multiple lines
- Snippets have default text and multiple cursor markers that the developer can jump with tab
- Snippets description is snippet

! Only in english !

### Main.js

- Listen to activation and deactivation events
- Detect java 8+ installed in path by running java -version
- Show button to open webpage to download openjdk if necessary by using systems url opener
- Detect debugging mode by analyzing process' environment (set in .vscode/launch.json)
- If debugging set connection by socket 5007
- If not debugging set connection by starting java process and using stdio
- Start language client and server
- Watch .Ⲙ and Ⲙ.json files and send file modified notifications to server
- Stop client when extension gets deactivated

## Main package

- Communicate with client using LSP4J
- Keep projects in sync with file system
- Incrementally validate projects when files modify
- Trigger project generation when no errors found
- Resolve document services like hover and completions

### Main.java

- Detect debugging mode by reading console arguments
- Listen for language client connection by stdio if not debugging
- Listen for language client connection by socket 5007 if debugging
- Listen to language client reconnection by socket 5007

### Server.java

Connection lifetime events

- Start listening for language client notifications and requests
- Initilize request: Send server capabilities + create a project foreach folder
- Initialized: Initialize all projects and publish created diagnostics
- Shutdown and Exit: Exit program with status 0

File and folder synchronization

- Folder created: Create project and publish diagnostics
- Folder removed: Remove project
- Detect containing projects of file
- File created: Read file + Signal containing projects about file modification and publish diagnostics
- File removed: Signal containing projects about file removal and publish diagnostics
- File modified: Signal containing projects about file modification and publish diagnostics

Language services

- Publish diagnostics of all projects in workspace
- Show alert if a file is opened outside of all projects
- Inspection services: Unwrap lsp4j parameters into file and position + ask containing projects + wrap results for lsp4j

Known issues

- ! Deleting first project sends a shutdown request and the server exits !

### Project.java

- Initialize: Detect all Ⲙ files + validate changes + analyze result
- Initialize: Detect configuration file and save parsed configuration
- Delete file: Validate change + analyze result or clean configuration
- Modify file: Validate change + analyze result or update configuration
- Delegate language services to inspector

Privately

- Analyze result: generate project if no errors
- Convert m.validation.problems to lsp4j.diagnostics
- Convert nodes to text ranges
- Convert offsets to line + character text positions

Known issues

- ! Converting nodes to text ranges can be done better by using NodeModel better !

## Validation package

### Validator.java

- Modify file: Validate syntax, scope and types
- Delete file: Signal deletion to scope and types
- Merge all problems in result.problems
- Save typed functions and components in result.game
- Detect if result has problems with error severity to signal validity of model

### SyntaxValidator.java

- Inject parser generated by xtext
- Convert xtext parsing errors to syntaxerror problems
- Return parsed ast model and problems

### ScopeValidator.java

- Clear obsolete memory
- Walk the parsed model
- Build result with the expression graph and problems

Variables

- Declare variables: Query entity and assigning value for the first time
- Standard variable: Redefinition error
- Declared variable: Bind to declaration
- Undeclared variable: Declare it
- Access variable: In value expressions and cell entities
- Standard variable : Type it
- Declared variable: Bind to declaration
- Undeclared variable: Undefined error

Components

- Declare component: Cells for the first time
- Standard component: Do nothing
- Declared component: Do nothing
- Undeclared component: Declare it
- Access component: Cells
- Standard component: Type it
- Declared component: Bind to declaration
- ! Undeclared component: Never happens !

Functions

- ! Declare functions: Never happens !
- Access function: In assignment, unary, binary and applications
- Standard function with same number of arguments: Type it, bind same type variables
- Non standard function: Undefined error in name

Blocks

- Standard block: Type it
- Non standard block: Undefined error
- Standard binding block: Type it
- Non standard block: Undefined error

### TypeValidator.java

Invalidate obsolete memory

- Remove file references from clusters
- Forget all components defined in now empty clusters
- Forget file existed

Validate new nodes

- Walk each connected component
- If component has been defined: Merge with definition cluster
- Save information provided by file in cluster: Types and components

Check clusters

- ! erase all memory !
- ! get all clusters ! should be affected ones only and do incremental
- Count types in cluster
- If zero types: Undecidable type error in each node of the cluster
- If one type: Type all components of cluster with that type
- If more types: Incompatible type error in each node of the cluster

Type functions

- ! Get all functions defined in all files !
- Type systems with systemType
- Convert functions to userFunctions and add to result

- ! Generate incremental problems only !

## Model package

### ExpressionGraph

- Maintain set of expression nodes. One per connected component.
- Convert expressions to ExpressionNodes
- Add bindings to each node of a binding
- Add a typing to a node with a reason
- ! Add connected component when typed if it has no bindings !
- ! When binding two nodes, if both are root, remove one; if none are root add one as root !
