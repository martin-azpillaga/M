## VSCode extension

- Define marketplace page's information
- Define bracket features and snippets declaratively
- Detect missing dependencies (Java 8+) and offer solutions
- Detect extension activation events and start language server
- Associate .Ⲙ and Ⲙ.json files with Ⲙ and watch for modifications

### Package.json

- Define name version publisher and license
- Define descriptions and keywords
- Define icon, preview label and no q&a section
- Link to webpage, repository and issues
- Contribute language Ⲙ for .Ⲙ files
- Activate extension when Ⲙ files opened or workspace contains a Ⲙ or Ⲙ.json file
- Activation starts in main.js
- Define dependency on vscode-language client and vscode engine (required by vsce)

### Brackets.json

- Indent and dedent automatically with {}
- Create folding markers with {}
- Highlighting bracket pairs for {} [] and ()
- Autoclose brackets {} [] ()
- Surround selection with brackets {} [] ()

### Snippets.json

- Snippets for foreach, if, set and system
- Snippets respect current indentation even if they span multiple lines
- Snippets have default text and multiple cursor markers that the developer can jump with tab
- Snippets description is snippet

! Only in english !

### Main.js

- Listen to activation and deactivation events
- Detect java 8+ installed in path by running java -version
- Show button to open webpage to download openjdk if necessary by using systems url opener
- Detect debugging mode by analyzing process' environment (set in .vscode/launch.json)
- If debugging set connection by socket 5007
- If not debugging set connection by starting java process and using stdio
- Start language client and server
- Watch .Ⲙ and Ⲙ.json files and send file modified notifications to server
- Stop client when extension gets deactivated

## Main package

- Communicate with client using LSP4J
- Keep projects in sync with file system
- Incrementally validate projects when files modify
- Trigger project generation when no errors found
- Resolve document services like hover and completions

### Main.java

- Detect debugging mode by reading console arguments
- Listen for language client connection by stdio if not debugging
- Listen for language client connection by socket 5007 if debugging
- Listen to language client reconnection by socket 5007

### Server.java

Connection lifetime events

- Start listening for language client notifications and requests
- Initilize request: Send server capabilities + create a project foreach folder
- Initialized: Initialize all projects and publish created diagnostics
- Shutdown and Exit: Exit program with status 0

File and folder synchronization

- Folder created: Create project and publish diagnostics
- Folder removed: Remove project
- Detect containing projects of file
- File created: Read file + Signal containing projects about file modification and publish diagnostics
- File removed: Signal containing projects about file removal and publish diagnostics
- File modified: Signal containing projects about file modification and publish diagnostics

Language services

- Publish diagnostics of all projects in workspace
- Show alert if a file is opened outside of all projects
- Inspection services: Unwrap lsp4j parameters into file and position + ask containing projects + wrap results for lsp4j

Known issues

- ! Deleting first project sends a shutdown request and the server exits !

### Project.java

- Initialize: Detect all Ⲙ files + validate changes + analyze result
- Initialize: Detect configuration file and save parsed configuration
- Delete file: Validate change + analyze result or clean configuration
- Modify file: Validate change + analyze result or update configuration
- Delegate language services to inspector

Privately

- Analyze result: generate project if no errors + return converted diagnostics
- Convert m.validation.problems to lsp4j.diagnostics

## Validation

- ! Get the nodes from expressionGraph or build the local data in expressionGraph !

### Global validator

- On validation: validate locally
- Save validation results in memory
- Invalidate obsolete memory
- Validate project globally
- Add local problems
- Add undecidable and incompatible type problems
- Add all functions to game
- Add all well typed components to game
- Detect repeated functions and report error in each file
- return game data
- ! Garbage is created when clusters are merged !

### Local validator Parse + 2 pass validation

- Parse text into model and syntax errors
- Handle empty files
- ! Declare all functions and components beforehand !
- Declare variables of assignments and bindingBlocks
- Access values, components, functions and blocks.
- ! Assignments have special treatment as hardcoded functions !
- Push and pop value stack

- build resulting data in context -> expressionGraph
- Add syntax errors from parsing and return

### Context

- Create redefined, undefined and unused problems
- Bind expressions together for same variable, same component, same function, same type variable
- Type expressions for standard variable, standard component, standard function, standard block

### ExpressionGraph

- Maintain set of expression nodes. One per connected component.
- Convert expressions to ExpressionNodes
- Add bindings to each node of a binding
- Add a typing to a node with a reason
- ! Add connected component when typed if it has no bindings !
- ! When binding two nodes, if both are root, remove one; if none are root add one as root !

## Model

### Parser

- Inject MParser generated by Xtext
- Parse text and return results

# Flow

Main: connect to client via socket 5007
Server: start listening
Server: set capabilities
Server: Initialize projects
Project: Find .Ⲙ files in root folder
Project: Trigger incremental build for each

GlobalValidator: Validate new file content locally
LocalValidator: Parse file text
Parser: Use injected generated MParser and parse
LocalValidator: Declare all functions and components globally
LocalValidator: Go through the AST model

LocalValidator and Context and ExpressionGraph: Interplay
LocalValidator: Control context's defined variables stack by pushing and poping in blocks
LocalValidator: Declare new variables if foreach expression or assignment to variable
LocalValidator: Access variables, components, functions and blocks of context

3 reasons for redefined error:
Context: Redefined error if variable is in the standard library or is a user function or component.
Context: Redefined error if component is in the standard library or is a user function.
Context: Redefined error if function is in the standard library or is a previous user function.

5 reasons for undefined errors:
Context: Undefined error if variable is not standard nor in scope
Context: ! Undefined error if block is not standard !
Context: Undefined error if function parameter count does not match with standard or user function
Context: Undefined error if function does not exist

Context: ! Unused value error if variable was in stack not anymore and has not been accessed !

ExpressionGraph: Convert expression to expressionNode
